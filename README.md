## Notes for Collaboration 

This section outlines the steps for collaborating on this project using Git. Each team member should follow these steps to ensure smooth collaboration and version control.

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Before you begin working on the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MouadGhouti/Trilingo.git
```

This will download the repository and its files to your local environment.

### 2. **Make Changes**

Make the necessary changes to the files in your local repository. Ensure your changes are properly tested and reviewed before committing.

### 3. **Stage and Commit Changes**

Once you are satisfied with your changes, stage them and commit with a meaningful message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
```

### 4. **Push Changes Directly to the `main` Branch**

After committing your changes locally, push them directly to the `main` branch of the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin main
```

This updates the `main` branch on the remote repository with your changes.

### 5. **Pull Updates Regularly**

To ensure your local repository stays up-to-date with the latest changes, regularly pull updates from the `main` branch:

```bash
git pull origin main
```

This ensures that your local environment reflects the latest state of the project.
