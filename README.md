## Typical Git Workflow

This section outlines the steps for collaborating on this project using Git. Each team member should follow these steps to ensure smooth collaboration and version control.

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Before you begin working on the project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
```

This will download the repository and its files to your local environment.

### 2. **Create a New Branch**

To work on a new feature or a specific part of the project, create a new branch. Replace `branch-name` with a name that describes the feature or task youâ€™re working on (e.g., `about-page`, `bugfix-form-validation`):

```bash
git checkout -b branch-name
```

This creates and switches you to the new branch, isolating your work from the `master` (or `main`) branch.

### 3. **Make Changes**

Make the necessary changes to your files. Once you're satisfied with the changes, you need to stage and commit them.

Stage all the changed files:

```bash
git add .
```

Then commit the changes with a meaningful commit message:

```bash
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"
```

### 4. **Push the Branch to the Remote Repository**

After committing your changes locally, push the branch to the remote repository:

```bash
git push origin branch-name
```

This uploads your branch to the remote GitHub repository so others can see your work.

### 5. **Create a Pull Request**

Once your feature or task is complete, go to the repository on GitHub and create a **Pull Request (PR)** to merge your branch into the `master` (or `main`) branch.

1. Go to your repository on GitHub.
2. Click the "Compare & pull request" button next to your branch.
3. Provide a description of the changes you made and submit the pull request.
4. Assign reviewers (if applicable) and await approval.

### 6. **Review and Merge**

Once the pull request is reviewed and approved, it will be merged into the `master` (or `main`) branch. You can then delete your feature branch to keep the repository clean:

```bash
git branch -d branch-name
git push origin --delete branch-name
```

### 7. **Update Your Local `master` Branch**

To stay updated with the latest changes, pull the latest version of the `master` (or `main`) branch into your local environment:

```bash
git checkout master
git pull origin master
```

This ensures your local `master` branch is in sync with the remote repository.
